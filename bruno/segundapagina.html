Some people live out selfish desire<br>
Some choose to shout when they speak and they'll be the star<br>
Caught in the flame of those deep in fire<br>
Seeking out those with a voice, one for tomorrow<br>
They say we've lost our minds<br>
We've just gained control<br>
Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free<br>
Fly past the edge of the sea<br>
No bended knee<br> 
No mockery<br>
Somehow we still carry on<br>
Silence your fear, we've got to move higher<br>
High like the stars in the sky, guiding us all<br>
Battle the will of those who conspire<br>
Take back the passion to live, vanish the sorrow<br>
Destroy their perfect crime, watch the power fold<br>
Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free<br>
Fly past the edge of the sea<br>
No bended knee<br>
No mockery<br>
Somehow we still carry on<br>
Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free<br>
Fly past the edge of the sea<br>
No bend in knee<br>
No mockery<br>
Somehow we still carry on<br>
Carry on<br>

All my life I've been debating<br>
All the crows they sit there waiting<br>
Wondering what I'm going to eat<br>
Until I have it I can't breathe<br>
I only see you on the floor<br>
Your hearts not beating anymore<br>
My lust for you it cannot wait<br>
Your skin it tastes like chocolate<br>
Staring blankly at the sun<br>
Waiting for my time to come<br>
Your good life it makes me sick<br>
All the screaming sounds like music<br>
Losing all my holy dreams<br>
Someone tell me what they mean<br>
There's a smell of iron blood in the air<br>
But I can't find it anywhere<br>
I've been waiting for someone to find me<br>
And become a part of me (A part of...)<br>
I've been waiting for you<br>
To come here br>
And kill me<br>
And set me free<br>
I've been waiting for the one<br>
Blood's flavor is so metallic<br>
It's smell makes me go phrenetic<br>
Textures that I find in you is a thick vicious glue<br>
Some nights I become so clean<br>
With all I touch and all I see<br>
There's an iron smell of blood in the air<br>
But now I see it everywhere<br>
I've been waiting for someone to find me<br>
And become a part of me (A part of me...)<br>
I've been waiting for you<br>
To come here<br>
And kill me<br>
And set me free (Oh)<br>
I've been waiting for the one<br>
I've been waiting for someone to find me<br> 
And become a part of me (A part of me...)<br>
I've been waiting for you to<br>
Come here<br>
And kill me (Oh)<br>
I've been waiting for the one<br>

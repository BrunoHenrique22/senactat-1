Lets take a moment and break the ice<br>
So my intentions are known<br>
See I pity in watching you suffer<br>
I know the feeling of feeling of being damned alone<br>
I got a storybook of my own<br>
Don't you see I am your pride<br>
Agent of wealth<br>
Bearer of needs<br>
And you know it's right<br>
I am your war<br>
Arming the strong<br>
Aiding the weak<br>
Know me by name<br>
Shepherd of fire<br>
Well I can promise you paradise<br>
No need to serve on your knees<br>
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours<br>
Take a moment and tell me who you see<br>
Won't tell ya who not to be<br>
Now you know I am your pride<br>
Agent of wealth<br>
Bearer of needs<br>
And you know it's right<br>
I am your war<br>
Arming the strong<br>
Aiding the weak<br>
Know me by name<br>
Shepherd of fire<br>
Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering<br>
Immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption<br>
Pardon your mind through the chains of the divine<br>
Make way, the shepherd of fire<br>
Through the ages of time<br>
I've been known for my hate<br>
But I'm a dealer of simple choices<br>
For me it's never too late<br>
I am your pride<br>
Agent of wealth<br>
Bearer of needs<br>
And you know it's right<br>
'Cause I am your war<br>
Arming the strong<br>
Aiding the weak<br>
I am your wrath<br>
I am your guilt<br>
I am your lust<br>
And you know it's right<br>
I am your love<br>
I am your stall<br> 
I am your trust<br>
Know me by name <br>
Shepherd of fire<br>
